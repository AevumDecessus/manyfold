# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

At least until we reach v1.0, only the latest release version is supported with security updates.

We do apply security patches whenever they become available, so make sure to track `latest` and check for updates regularly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability in Manyfold, please email [security@manyfold.app](mailto:security@manyfold.app)
to let us know confidentially, so that we can decide when to disclose the vulnerability, at which point it will be 
logged in our GitHub issue tracker.
